After building and opening in xCode:
In UnityAppController.h, #import "AudioPluginInterface.h"
In UnityAppController.mm, add the following line to preStartUnity{}:
UnityRegisterAudioPlugin(&UnityGetAudioEffectDefinitions);
Comment out all errors from OSX as you get them, then everything will work.
I built the static library for arm64 only so it probably wont work on iPads,
Also I didnt even attempt to get it working on Android.
